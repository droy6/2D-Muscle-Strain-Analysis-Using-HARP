function [F]=design_filter(w,r,d,an,N,scale)
% This function designs a band pass filter centered at w
% frequency and with elliptic ratios r. For localization in
% both spatial and frequency domain, a gaussian baundary of
% standard deviation d is added. The axes of the elipse can
% be rotated by an degrees.
%
% w  : 2 X 1  frequency shift
% r  : 2 X 1  radius
% d  : Gaussian standard deviation
% an : rotation angle in degrees
% N  : # of points
% scale : 2 X maximum frequency
